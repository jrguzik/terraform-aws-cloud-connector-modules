## This is only a sample terraform.tfvars file.
## Uncomment and change the below variables according to your specific environment


#####################################################################################################################
##### Variables 1-19 are populated automically if terraform is ran via ZSEC bash script.   ##### 
##### Modifying the variables in this file will override any inputs from ZSEC             #####
#####################################################################################################################


#####################################################################################################################
##### Cloud Init Userdata Provisioning variables  #####
#####################################################################################################################

## 1. Zscaler Cloud Connector Provisioning URL E.g. connector.zscaler.net/api/v1/provUrl?name=aws_prov_url

#cc_vm_prov_url                             = "connector.zscaler.net/api/v1/provUrl?name=aws_prov_url"

## 2. AWS Secrets Manager Secret Name from Secrets Manager E.g ZS/CC/credentials

#secret_name                                =  "ZS/CC/credentials/aws_cc_secret_name"

## 3. Cloud Connector cloud init provisioning listener port. This is required for GWLB and Health Probe deployments. 
## Uncomment and set custom probe port to a single value of 80 or any number between 1024-65535. Default is 50000.

#http_probe_port                            = 50000


#####################################################################################################################
##### Custom variables. Only change if required for your environment  #####
#####################################################################################################################

## 4. AWS region where Cloud Connector resources will be deployed. This environment variable is automatically populated if running ZSEC script
##    and thus will override any value set here. Only uncomment and set this value if you are deploying terraform standalone. (Default: us-west-2)

#aws_region                                 = "us-west-2"


## 5. Cloud Connector AWS EC2 Instance size selection. Uncomment ccvm_instance_type line with desired vm size to change.
##    (Default: m5.large)

#ccvm_instance_type                         = "t3.medium"
#ccvm_instance_type                         = "m5.large"
#ccvm_instance_type                         = "c5.large"
#ccvm_instance_type                         = "c5a.large"
#ccvm_instance_type                         = "m5.2xlarge"
#ccvm_instance_type                         = "c5.2xlarge"
#ccvm_instance_type                         = "m5.4xlarge"
#ccvm_instance_type                         = "c5.4xlarge"


## 6. The number of Cloud Connector Subnets to create in sequential availability zones. Available input range 1-3 (Default: 2)
##    **** NOTE - This value will be ignored if byo_vpc / byo_subnets

#az_count                                   = 2


## 7. The minumum number of Cloud Connectors to maintain in an Autoscaling group. (Default: 2)
##    Recommendation is to maintain HA/Zonal resliency so for example if az_count = 2 and cross_zone_lb_enabled is false the minimum number of CCs you would want for a
##    production deployment would be 4

#min_size                                   = 2


## 8. The maximum number of Cloud Connectors to maintain in an Autoscaling group. (Default: 4)

#max_size                                   = 4


## 9. The amount of time until EC2 Auto Scaling performs the first health check on new instances after they are put into service. (Default: 900 seconds/15 minutes)

#health_check_grace_period                  = 900


## 10. Network Configuration:

##    IPv4 CIDR configured with VPC creation. All Subnet resources (Workload, Public, Cloud Connector, Route 53) will be created based off this prefix
##    /24 subnets are created assuming this cidr is a /16. If you require creating a VPC smaller than /16, you may need to explicitly define all other 
##     subnets via public_subnets, workload_subnets, cc_subnets, and route53_subnets variables

##    Note: This variable only applies if you let Terraform create a new VPC. Custom deployment with byo_vpc enabled will ignore this

#vpc_cidr                                   = "10.1.0.0/16"

##    Subnet space. (Minimum /28 required. Default is null). If you do not specify subnets, they will automatically be assigned based on the default cidrsubnet
##    creation within the VPC CIDR block. Uncomment and modify if byo_vpc is set to true but byo_subnets is left false meaning you want terraform to create 
##    NEW subnets in that existing VPC. OR if you choose to modify the vpc_cidr from the default /16 so a smaller CIDR, you may need to edit the below variables 
##    to accommodate that address space.

##    ***** Note *****
##    It does not matter how many subnets you specify here. this script will only create in order 1 or as many as defined in the az_count variable
##    Default/Minumum: 1 - Maximum: 3
##    Example: If you change vpc_cidr to "10.2.0.0/24", set below variables to cidrs that fit in that /24 like cc_subnets = ["10.2.0.0/27","10.2.0.32/27"] etc.

#public_subnets                             = ["10.x.y.z/24","10.x.y.z/24"]
#cc_subnets                                 = ["10.x.y.z/24","10.x.y.z/24"]
#route53_subnets                            = ["10.x.y.z/24","10.x.y.z/24"]


## 11. Tag attribute "Owner" assigned to all resoure creation. (Default: "zscc-admin")

#owner_tag                                  = "username@company.com"


## 12. By default, Cloud Connectors are configured with a callhome IAM policy enabled. This is recommended for production deployments
##     The policy creation itself does not provide any authentication/authorization access. IAM details are still required to be provided
##     to Zscaler in order to establish a trust relationship. Uncomment if you do not want this policy created. (Default: true)

#cc_callhome_enabled                        = false


## 13. By default, GWLB deployments are configured as zonal. Uncomment if you want to enable cross-zone load balancing
##     functionality. Only applicable for gwlb deployment types. (Default: false)

#cross_zone_lb_enabled                      = true


## 14. If set to true, add a warm pool to the specified Auto Scaling group. See [warm_pool](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/autoscaling_group#warm_pool).
##     Uncomment to enable. (Default: false)

#warm_pool_enabled                          = true


## 15. Sets the instance state to transition to after the lifecycle hooks finish. Valid values are: Stopped (default) or Running. Ignored when 'warm_pool_enabled' is false
##     Uncomment the desired value

#warm_pool_state                            = "Stopped"
#warm_pool_state                            = "Running"


## 16. Specifies the minimum number of instances to maintain in the warm pool. This helps you to ensure that there is always a certain number of warmed instances available to handle traffic spikes. Ignored when 'warm_pool_enabled' is false
##     Uncomment and specify a desired minimum number of Cloud Connectors to maintain deployed in a warm pool

#warm_pool_min_size                         = 1


## 17. Specifies the total maximum number of instances that are allowed to be in the warm pool or in any state except Terminated for the Auto Scaling group. Ignored when 'warm_pool_enabled' is false
##     Uncomment and specify a desired maximum number of Cloud Connectors to maintain deployed in a warm pool

#warm_pool_max_group_prepared_capacity      = 2


## 18. Specifies whether instances in the Auto Scaling group can be returned to the warm pool on scale in
##     Uncomment to enable. (Default: false)

#reuse_on_scale_in                          = true


## 19. Target value number for autoscaling policy CPU utilization target tracking. ie: trigger a scale in/out to keep average CPU Utliization percentage across all instances at/under this number
##     (Default: 70%)

#target_cpu_util_value                      = 70



#####################################################################################################################
##### ZPA/Route 53 specific variables #####
#####################################################################################################################

## 20. By default, ZPA dependent resources are not created. Uncomment if you want to enable ZPA configuration in your VPC
##     Enabling will create 1x dedicated subnet per Cloud Connector availability zones in the VPC with Route Tables pointing
##     default route to the local AZ GWLB Endpoint. Module will also create a resolver endpoint and rules per the domains
##     specified in variable "domain_names". (Default: false)

#zpa_enabled                                = true

## 21. Provide the domain names you want Route53 to redirect to Cloud Connector for ZPA interception. Only applicable for base + zpa or zpa_enabled = true
##     deployment types where Route53 subnets, Resolver Rules, and Outbound Endpoints are being created. Two example domains are populated to show the 
##     mapping structure and syntax. ZPA Module will read through each to create a resolver rule per domain_name entry. Ucomment domain_names variable and
##     add any additional appsegXX mappings as needed.

#domain_names = {
#  appseg1 = "app1.com"
#  appseg2 = "app2.com"
#}


#####################################################################################################################
##### Custom BYO variables. Only applicable for deployments without "base" resource requirements  #####
#####                                 E.g. "cc_ha, cc_gwlb, cc_gwlb_asg"                             #####
#####################################################################################################################

## 22. By default, this script will create a new AWS VPC.
##     Uncomment if you want to deploy all resources to a VPC that already exists (true or false. Default: false)

#byo_vpc                                    = true


## 23. Provide your existing VPC ID. Only uncomment and modify if you set byo_vpc to true. (Default: null)
##     Example: byo_vpc_id = "vpc-0588ce674df615334"

#byo_vpc_id                                 = "vpc-0588ce674df615334"


## 24. By default, this script will create new AWS subnets in the VPC defined based on az_count.
##     Uncomment if you want to deploy all resources to subnets that already exist (true or false. Default: false)
##     Dependencies require in order to reference existing subnets, the corresponding VPC must also already exist.
##     Setting byo_subnet to true means byo_vpc must ALSO be set to true.

#byo_subnets                                = true


## 25. Provide your existing Cloud Connector private subnet IDs. Only uncomment and modify if you set byo_subnets to true.
##     Subnet IDs must be added as a list with order determining assocations for resources like aws_instance, NAT GW,
##     Route Tables, etc. Provide only one subnet per Availability Zone in a VPC
##
##     ##### This script will create Route Tables with default 0.0.0.0/0 next-hop to the corresponding NAT Gateways
##     ##### that are created or exists in the VPC Public Subnets. If you already have CC Subnets created, disassociate
##     ##### any route tables to them prior to deploying this script.
##
##     Example: byo_cc_subnet_ids = ["subnet-05c32f4aa6bc02f8f","subnet-13b35f23y6uc36f3s"]

#byo_subnet_ids                             = ["subnet-id"]


## 26. By default, this script will create a new Internet Gateway resource in the VPC.
##     Uncomment if you want to utlize an IGW that already exists (true or false. Default: false)
##     Dependencies require in order to reference an existing IGW, the corresponding VPC must also already exist.
##     Setting byo_igw to true means byo_vpc must ALSO be set to true.

#byo_igw                                    = true


## 27. Provide your existing Internet Gateway ID. Only uncomment and modify if you set byo_igw to true.
##     Example: byo_igw_id = "igw-090313c21ffed44d3"

#byo_igw_id                                 = "igw-090313c21ffed44d3"


## 28. By default, this script will create new Public Subnets, and NAT Gateway w/ Elastic IP in the VPC defined or selected.
##     It will also create a Route Table forwarding default 0.0.0.0/0 next hop to the Internet Gateway that is created or defined 
##     based on the byo_igw variable and associate with the public subnet(s)
##     Uncomment if you want to deploy Cloud Connectors routing to NAT Gateway(s)/Public Subnet(s) that already exist (true or false. Default: false)
##     
##     Setting byo_ngw to true means no additional Public Subnets, Route Tables, or Elastic IP resources will be created

#byo_ngw                                    = true


## 29. Provide your existing NAT Gateway IDs. Only uncomment and modify if you set byo_cc_subnet to true
##     NAT Gateway IDs must be added as a list with order determining assocations for the CC Route Tables (cc-rt)
##     nat_gateway_id next hop
##
##     ***** Note 1 *****
##     This script will create Route Tables with default 0.0.0.0/0 next-hop to the corresponding NAT Gateways
##     whether they are created or already exist in the VPC Public Subnets. If you already have CC Subnets created, do not associate
##     any route tables to them.
##
##     ***** Note 2 *****
##     CC Route Tables will loop through all available NAT Gateways whether created via az_count variable or defined
##     below with existing IDs. If bringing your own NAT Gateways with multiple subnets with a desire to maintain zonal
##     affinity ensure you enter the list of NAT GW IDs in order of 1. if creating CC subnets az_count will 
##     go in order az1, az2, etc. 2. if byo_subnet_ids, map this list NAT Gateway ID-1 to Subnet ID-1, etc.
##     
##     Example: byo_cc_natgw_ids = ["nat-0e1351f3e8025a30e","nat-0e98fc3d8e09ed0e9"]

#byo_ngw_ids                                = ["nat-id"]


## 30. By default, this script will create new IAM roles, policy, and Instance Profiles for the Cloud Connector
##     Uncomment if you want to use your own existing IAM Instance Profiles (true or false. Default: false)

#byo_iam                                    = true


## 31. Provide your existing Instance Profile resource names. Only uncomment and modify if you set byo_iam to true

##    Example: byo_iam_instance_profile_id     = ["instance-profile-1","instance-profile-2"]

#byo_iam_instance_profile_id                = ["instance-profile-1"]


## 32. By default, this script will create new Security Groups for the Cloud Connector mgmt and service interfaces
##     Uncomment if you want to use your own existing SGs (true or false. Default: false)

#byo_security_group                         = true


## 33. Provide your existing Security Group resource names. Only uncomment and modify if you set byo_security_group to true

##    Example: byo_mgmt_security_group_id     = ["mgmt-sg-1","mgmt-sg-2"]
##    Example: byo_service_security_group_id  = ["service-sg-1","service-sg-2"]

#byo_mgmt_security_group_id                 = ["mgmt-sg-1"]
#byo_service_security_group_id              = ["service-sg-1"]
